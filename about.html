      <p>Hi, my names Nick Wilmas. I am a 20 year old developer currently studying computer science in college. I plan to get a degree in Computer Science and go on as a full time developer. I plan on graduating in May of 2022. Since a kid I have
        always been in love with computers. I started my programming journey on a kids website called "Roblox". For some, this is just a website where kids can play video games. To me this website taught me basic code and how to develop games. I
        started writing code when I was about 12 years old. I have been in love with programming ever since that. I have taught myself many different languages and have been contracted by a couple independent game developers to help further there
        development.</p>
